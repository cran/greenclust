Title: Combine Categories Using Greenacre's Method
Version: 1.1.1
Authors@R: person("Jeff", "Jetton", , "jeff.jetton@gmail.com", c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements a method of iteratively collapsing the rows of a
    contingency table, two at a time, by selecting the pair of categories whose
    combination yields a new table with the smallest loss of chi-squared, as
    described by Greenacre, M.J. (1988) <doi:10.1007/BF01901670>. The result is
    compatible with the class of object returned by the 'stats' package's
    hclust() function and can be used similarly (plotted as a dendrogram,
    cut, etc.). Additional functions are provided for automatic cutting and
    diagnostic plotting.
